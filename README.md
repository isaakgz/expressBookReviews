# Book Review Application

This is a Book Review Application built with Node.js and Express. It uses JWT for authentication and Express Session for managing user sessions.

## IBM-ExpressBookReview-Coursera

This project is the final project for the IBM course, where we will build a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server. The server will use authentication at the session level using JWT. We will then test the application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.

## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- User session management with Express Session
- CRUD operations for books
- Ability to add reviews for books
- User management (register, login, logout)
